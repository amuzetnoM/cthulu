## ⚡ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Open the Interactive Map (30 seconds)

```bash
# Just open the HTML file in your browser
open system_map.html        # macOS
xdg-open system_map.html    # Linux  
start system_map.html       # Windows
```

- 🗺️ Interactive graph with 40 components
- 🎨 Color-coded by component type
- 🔍 Hover over nodes for detailed info
- 🚨 Red badges show issues

**Try this:**
1. Click and drag nodes to reposition
2. Scroll to zoom in/out
3. Hover over the purple "Cognition Engine" node
4. Click "trading_loop" to see the critical issue

### Step 2: Run the Analyzer (2 minutes)

```bash
# Run the automated code scanner
python analyze_cthulu.py

# Output will show:
# ✅ Total lines, functions, classes
# ⚠️ Critical issues found
# 📏 Largest files
# 🧠 Most complex files
# 💡 Recommendations
```

**What you'll get:**
- Console summary with key metrics
- `analysis_report.json` with full details
- List of critical issues to address
- Actionable recommendations

### Step 3: Read the Executive Summary (5 minutes)

```bash
cat EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
# Or open in your Markdown viewer
```

**What you'll learn:**
