SENTINEL - Independent Cthulu Guardian System
=============================================
Completely separate from Cthulu - monitors, protects, and recovers.

This is NOT part of Cthulu. It is an independent watchdog system
that survives Cthulu crashes and orchestrates recovery.

Launch: python -m sentinel
Dashboard: python -m sentinel.gui
