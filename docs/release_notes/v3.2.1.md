# v[3.2.1]
> 2025-12-17

Summary
Focused on operational reliability for trade adoption and SL/TP handling, improved close flows, better observability, and repository hygiene (archival + backups).

Highlights
- SL/TP verification & retry queue with Prometheus metric `cthulhu_sl_tp_failure_total`.
- Exponential backoff retry scheduling for retriable operations.
- Close flow improvements (IOC filling, comment sanitization, fallback retry).
- Metrics recording for closes and SL/TP events.
- Archived ad-hoc diagnostic scripts into `cthulhu/.archive/` and created a backup snapshot.
- Documentation updates: `cthulhu/docs/system_mapping.md` and `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`.

Notes
This release prepares the codebase for introducing ML instrumentation and pipeline work next. The new ML work (instrumentation + integration test) is tracked under UNRELEASED In-Progress.
