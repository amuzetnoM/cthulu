# [v3.3.1]

Summary
- Adds advisory and ghost modes to support safe ad-hoc validation and advisory-only operation.
- News & calendar ingest pipeline with RSS/NewsAPI/FRED/TradingEconomics adapters; normalized calendar event importance and TradeMonitor alerting.
- ML instrumentation improvements: new event types and ingest plumbing for news and advisory signals.
- Various unit tests and gated integration tests for news ingest and advisory modes.

Changed
- Documentation: updated `docs/rpc.md`, `Cthulu/.env`, and `README` to reflect default RPC behavior and Linux MT5 options.

Fixed
- Changelog and release notes tidied for consistency.

Notes
- News ingestion is opt-in; enable with `NEWS_INGEST_ENABLED=1` or set `config['news']['enabled']=true`.
- Advisory/ghost modes are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled via `config['advisory']` or runtime config.
