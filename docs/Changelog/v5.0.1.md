# v5.0.1 — 2025-12-28

Release type: Patch / Branding & stability

## Summary
Complete repository rebranding from "Herald" → "Cthulu" and a set of stability and observability improvements validated by live testing. This release standardizes package and CLI names, fixes runtime indicator merge issues, and improves monitoring/CI for cross-platform builds.

## Highlights
- Full rebrand: `herald` → `Cthulu` across code, docs, scripts, and CI.
- Fixes to runtime indicator handling to avoid pandas join collisions (namespacing and safe joins).
- Risk evaluator improvements to accept both dict and object account_info formats.
- New monitoring and observability tooling (PowerShell monitor script, Prometheus/Grafana config pointers).
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow added for building/pushing containers (GHCR) and cross-platform testing.

## Added
- `runtime_` namespacing and aliasing for dynamically-added indicators to prevent DataFrame column overlap.
- `scripts/monitor_cthulu.ps1` — auto-restart monitor that logs incidents to `SYSTEM_REPORT.md`.
- GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish Docker images to GHCR (tags: `5`, `5.0.1`).
- Additional unit tests and CI coverage improvements.

## Changed
- Package and CLI names updated to `cthulu` / `Cthulu` (imports, entry points, docs, and launcher scripts).
- Dockerfile CMD adjusted to `python -m cthulu`.
- Many documentation pages and examples updated to reflect the new branding and commands.

## Fixed
- Prevent `pandas.DataFrame.join` ValueError caused by overlapping columns by renaming runtime columns and using safe joins with suffixes and fallbacks.
- `RiskEvaluator.approve()` and related methods now accept account info returned as either dict or object (robust balance extraction).
- Misc Windows console encoding and logging fixes.

## Upgrade notes
1. Update imports and CLI invocations:
   - `from herald import ...` → `from cthulu import ...`
   - `python -m herald` → `python -m Cthulu` (or `python -m cthulu` CLI on some installs)
2. Update environment variables if you rely on them: `HERALD_*` → `Cthulu_*`.
3. Recommended: run unit tests and a `--dry-run --max-loops 1` smoke test before enabling live trading.

## Breaking changes
- Import paths and CLI names changed (`herald` → `Cthulu`). Update any external scripts, automation, or deployment that reference old names.

## Acknowledgements
- Release drafted from `RELEASE_BODY.md` and project changelog. Thanks to contributors: @copilot, @amuzetnoM and the automation tooling that assisted the rebrand.
