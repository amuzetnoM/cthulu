# Herald v5.0.0 — 2025-12-27

## Summary
Major architecture and runtime stability release following live validation. This release addresses issues found during live runs, hardens runtime indicator handling, removes a blocking live-run safety gate in favor of a warning, and adds CI improvements (Windows + coverage).

## Highlights
- Runtime indicator namespacing (`runtime_*`) to avoid DataFrame join collisions.
- Alias columns for strategy convenience (`rsi`, `rsi_7`, `atr`, `adx`) plus fallback computation when missing.
- Removal of `LIVE_RUN_CONFIRM` gate (now logs a warning when live_run=true).
- Unit tests added for runtime indicator behavior.
- CI workflow extended to run on Windows and upload coverage reports.

## Notes from live validation (2025-12-27)
- Observed `ValueError: columns overlap but no suffix specified` when runtime indicators produced columns that matched existing names; fixed by namespacing.
- Strategies occasionally ran before indicators were present; fixed by alias fallback and ensuring ATR/RSI are available before strategy decisions where possible.
- Unicode logging issue on Windows consoles addressed by removing non-ASCII checkmarks.

## Upgrade/Migration steps
1. Pull the latest code and update your `.env` and `config.json` if using environment-based overrides.
2. Run unit tests and the integration smoke test in a demo account before enabling live trading.
3. Review `CHANGELOG.md` and release notes for further guidance.
