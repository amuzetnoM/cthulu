# PRIVACY & POLICIES

Last updated: December 28, 2025

## Overview
Cthulu is an open-source autonomous trading system that runs locally on your machine. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about data handling.

## Data Collection
Cthulu does not collect, transmit, or store personal data on external servers by default. All data remains on your local machine:

- Trading data: stored locally in `Cthulu.db` (SQLite)
- Log files: stored in `logs/`
- Configuration: local files (use environment variables for secrets)

## Third-Party Services
Cthulu may interact with third-party services (MT5, news APIs, monitoring stacks). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and your API keys.

## Data Security
- Use environment variables or `.env` for credentials
- Do not commit API keys to version control
- Restrict file permissions on config and DB files

## Your Rights
You control data on your machine: delete, export, or modify as needed. Review the source to verify data handling.

## Contact
Open an issue on GitHub for privacy concerns.
