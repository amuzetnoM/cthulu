## 🎯 UI OVERHAUL COMPLETE (2026-01-02)

### Major Update: Comprehensive Trading Dashboard

**File:** `ui/desktop.py`

The UI has been completely overhauled with a modern tabbed interface:

#### Features:
1. **Dashboard Tab** - Account summary cards, strategy/regime info, performance metrics, open positions
2. **Trades Tab** - Live positions from MT5, trade history from database, manual trade panel
3. **Log Tab** - Filtered log viewer with color-coded log levels

#### Improvements:
- Direct MT5 position reading (real-time P&L, not log parsing)
- CSV metrics integration (comprehensive_metrics.csv, indicator_metrics.csv)
- Tabbed navigation for better organization
- Modern dark theme with purple accent (Cthulu brand)
- Profit/loss color coding
- Strategy and regime display with color indicators

#### Flow:
```
Wizard → Configure → UI Dashboard + Sentinel (crash resilience)
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (2026-01-02 18:00Z)

### Issue 1: UNKNOWN Symbol Bug - FIXED

**Problem:** Positions tracked without proper symbol causing exit failures:
```
Error: Cannot determine market price for UNKNOWN
```

**Root Cause:** `track_position()` was trying to get symbol from metadata fallbacks before querying MT5.

**Fix Applied:**
1. **`position/manager.py - track_position()`**: Now queries MT5 FIRST as source of truth
2. **`position/manager.py - close_position()`**: Always verifies symbol from MT5 before closing
3. **`position/manager.py - reconcile_positions()`**: Now fixes UNKNOWN symbols for existing positions
4. **`core/trading_loop.py - _execute_real_order()`**: Explicitly passes symbol in track_metadata

### Issue 2: Weekend Protection for Crypto - FIXED

**Problem:** Crypto positions (BTC, ETH) being closed for "weekend protection" even though crypto trades 24/7.

**Fix Applied:**
- **`exit/time_based.py - _check_weekend_protection()`**: Added crypto symbol detection
- Crypto prefixes excluded: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, ADA, DOT, DOGE, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, LINK, UNI, ATOM, XLM
- Returns `None` for crypto symbols, skipping weekend protection

### Design Principles Enforced:
1. **MT5 is source of truth** - Always query MT5 for position data
2. **Never use placeholders** - Reject operations if data is UNKNOWN
3. **Asset-aware logic** - Different assets have different market hours

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (2026-01-02 Earlier)

### Issue: Performance Regression After ML/Cognition Upgrades

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The cognition engine was being TOO RESTRICTIVE, blocking signals that the rule-based system should have processed. The ML enhancements were designed to enhance, but were inadvertently penalizing.

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. CognitionEngine Signal Enhancement (`cognition/engine.py`)
- **BEFORE:** Confidence multiplier could drop to 0.75x (25% penalty)
- **AFTER:** Floor set at 0.85x (max 15% penalty)
- **Philosophy:** Boost more, penalize less - rule-based signals are already validated

#### 2. CognitionEngine `should_trade()` Method
- **BEFORE:** Blocked on choppy markets and sentiment caution
- **AFTER:** Advisory only - logs warnings but allows rule-based system to decide
- **Exception:** Only blocks on CRITICAL upcoming events (NFP, FOMC, etc.)

#### 3. `trade_allowed` Property
- **BEFORE:** Blocked on choppy + low prediction OR sentiment caution
- **AFTER:** Only blocks in EXTREME conditions (>80% confidence choppy + <40% prediction)

#### 4. AdaptiveAccountManager Phase Configs
- **MICRO Phase:**
  - min_signal_confidence: 0.70 → 0.50
  - min_risk_reward: 1.5 → 1.2
  - max_concurrent_positions: 1 → 2
  - max_trades_per_hour: 10 → 15
  
- **SEED Phase:**
  - min_signal_confidence: 0.65 → 0.55
  - min_risk_reward: 1.8 → 1.5
  - max_concurrent_positions: 2 → 3

### Design Principle Reinforced:
> **Rule-based system is PRIMARY. Cognition ENHANCES, never GATES.**

## Live Monitoring Plan (Started: 2025-12-31T15:57:16.0529229+05:00)
- Phase 4: Ultra-Aggressive RUNNING (1h) — live trading, observability suite ON, dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8888/observability/reporting/dashboard.html
- Next: Aggressive → Balanced → Conservative (each 1h), sequential
- CSV pillars: comprehensive_metrics.csv, indicator_metrics.csv, system_health.csv (5s refresh)
- Actions: precision tuning (dynamic SL/TP, adaptive drawdown), continuous benchmarking, system health checks

## Restarted Live Session (Ultra-Aggressive)
- MT5 Terminal: STARTED via detected install path
- Cthulu: RESTARTED in live mode (no flags) to auto-wire MT5
- Dashboard: Expanded to show ALL CSV metrics dynamically
- Next: 1h per mindset (Ultra→Aggressive→Balanced→Conservative) with continuous tuning

## Precision Tuning Applied (2025-12-31T16:25:16.0918196+05:00)
### Ultra-Aggressive Enhancements:
- confidence_threshold: 0.25 → 0.15 (more signal generation)
- adx_threshold: 20 → 15 (trend detection in weaker trends)
- momentum rsi_threshold: 50 → 45 (earlier momentum detection)
- momentum lookback_period: 15 → 12 (faster breakout detection)
### Observations:
- CSVs populating correctly (account data, indicators flowing)
- Trade/signal counts at 0 = normal (waiting for crossover conditions)
- RSI ~58-61, ADX ~14 (ranging market, weak trend)
- Market regime: RANGING - scalping/mean_reversion strategies optimal

---

## Autonomous Enhancement Session: 2025-12-31T16:34:35Z

### Phase 1: Ultra-Aggressive Configuration Applied
**Config Changes:**
- Added mean_reversion strategy for overbought/oversold trading
- Enhanced scalping: rsi_overbought 80→75, spread_limit 2.0→5.0 pips
- Added rsi_long_max=70, rsi_short_min=30 for recovery zone trading
- Confidence threshold: 0.25→0.15 (more signal generation)
- ADX threshold: 20→15 (trend detection in weaker trends)
- Momentum RSI threshold: 50→45 (earlier momentum detection)

### System Status (Live):
- **MT5 Connected:** XMGlobal-MT5 6 (account: ****0069)
- **Balance:** $1127.99
- **Mode:** Live Trading ENABLED
- **Strategies:** 6 active (EMA, Momentum, Scalping, Trend, SMA, Mean_Reversion)
- **Regime:** ranging_tight (scalping optimal)
- **RSI:** 89.7 (overbought - avoiding longs correctly)
- **ADX:** 22.6 (moderate trend)

### Market Observation:
BTC is in extreme overbought territory (RSI>85). System is correctly:
1. NOT buying at the top
2. Waiting for EMA crossover to SHORT
3. Mean_reversion strategy can trigger when price touches upper BB

### Next Actions:
- Continue monitoring for signal generation
- Watch for RSI pullback or EMA crossover
- System will trade automatically when conditions align


### New Strategy Implemented: RSI Reversal (2025-12-31T16:38:40Z)
**Purpose:** Trade purely based on RSI extremes without waiting for crossovers
**Configuration:**
- rsi_extreme_overbought: 85 (SHORT when RSI drops from this level)
- rsi_extreme_oversold: 25 (LONG when RSI rises from this level)
- cooldown_bars: 2 (minimum bars between signals)

**Current Market State:**
- RSI: 89.6 (above overbought threshold)
- When RSI drops below 85, RSI Reversal will generate SHORT signal
- System now has 7 active strategies for maximum opportunity capture

### Strategy Arsenal:
1. EMA Crossover (fast=8, slow=21)
2. Momentum Breakout (lookback=12, rsi=45)
3. Scalping (fast_ema=5, slow_ema=10, rsi_ob=75)
4. Trend Following (ADX=15)
5. SMA Crossover (short=5, long=13)
6. Mean Reversion (BB+RSI)
7. RSI Reversal (NEW - pure RSI trading)
