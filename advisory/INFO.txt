This directory , advisory and ghost modes were initially intended to be the async modules for llm training and trading insigihts and experience.
However, the actual vector database and llm modules were implemented in the core/llm and core/vector_db directories and are planned to be integrated into these 2 modules. 
These were designed for this.
Advirosry to give async hands on control over trading and ghost mode to do it fully silently in the background.

these 2 modes need to be upgraded into what they were intended to be.
The advisory mode should be able to give trading insights and suggestions based on llm analysis of market data and trading history.
The ghost mode should be able to trade silently in the background using llm analysis and vector db
to make trading decisions without user intervention.
These modules need to be integrated with the core/llm and core/vector_db modules to leverage their capabilities.
This will require significant development effort to implement the llm analysis and vector db integration into these modules.
Once implemented these modules will provide powerful tools for traders to leverage llm and vector db technology for improved trading performance.
They will also serve as examples of how to integrate llm and vector db technology into trading applications.
They will also need to be tested thoroughly to ensure they function as intended and provide accurate trading insights and decisions.
The advisory mode should provide real-time trading suggestions based on llm analysis of market data and trading history.
The ghost mode should be able to trade silently in the background using llm analysis and vector db to make trading decisions without user intervention.
These modules should also provide configuration options to customize their behavior and trading strategies.
These modules should also provide logging and reporting features to track their performance and trading decisions.
These modules should also be documented thoroughly to provide guidance on their usage and configuration.
