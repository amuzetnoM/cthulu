## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Is Cthulu production-ready today?
**A**: Yes, for small-scale deployment (<$1000 capital) with manual monitoring. For enterprise use, complete Phase 1 first.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A**: Poor exception handling (585 broad catches) could hide critical failures. Address this first.

### Q: How long to implement all improvements?
**A**: 6-12 months for Phases 1-4. Phase 5 (Innovation) is optional, 6+ months additional.

### Q: What's the ROI of improvements?
**A**: 
- Phase 1: Infinite (prevent catastrophic failures)
- Phase 2: Very High (90% downtime reduction)
- Phase 3: High (30% cost reduction)
- Phase 4: Very High (+20-30% Sharpe improvement)

### Q: Can I deploy while implementing improvements?
**A**: Yes, but:
- Start with conservative mindset
- Use small capital (<$1000)
- Monitor closely (manual checks)
- Have backup plan
- Fix critical issues (C1-C3) within first month
